# Squair

A collaborative drawing tool, Squair allows many users to connect and create together.

## Getting Started

For development, simply clone this repository and run the database build script (dbBuild/squair.sql).

### Prerequisites

You will need:

```
JavaEE
Glassfish Server
MySQL
IDE which supports full-stack editing (development team currently using NetBeans)
```

## Deployment

Currently we haven't deployed live ourselves, so your guess is as good as ours about what special things need to be done.
